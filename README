Good opportunity to publish some free software.

Please make the initial commit with unmodified files, so we have an
easier time tracking changes you make.

Copyright and license are MIT style. You can override any proprietary
notice in a second commit, and copy the license from XCVB.

The README may or may not be useful. I let you judge how useful it is or is=
n't.

If you feel this software is no good for your purposes, just don't
bother publishing it.

Thanks!
